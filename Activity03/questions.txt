QUESTION AND ANSWER:

1. How does the format() function help in combining variables with text in Python? Can you provide a simple example?
The format() function helps insert values into a string in an organized way using {} as placeholders.

2. Explain the basic difference between opening a file in 'read' mode ('r') and 'write' mode ('w') in Python. When would you use each
'r' (read mode) is used to open and read an existing file. If the file doesn't exist, an error occurs.

'w' (write mode) is used to create or overwrite a file. If the file exists, it deletes the old content.

3. Describe what string slicing is in Python. Provide a basic example of extracting a substring from a larger string.
String slicing lets you take part of a string using index numbers.

4. When saving information to a file in Python, what is the purpose of using the 'a' mode instead of the 'w' mode? Provide a straightforward example.
'a' (append mode) adds new content without deleting the old data.

'w' (write mode) replaces the old content with new data.

5. Write a simple Python code snippet to open and read a file named "data.txt." How would you handle the case where the file might not exist?
